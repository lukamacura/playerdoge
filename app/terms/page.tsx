      <h2 className="font-bold mt-8 mb-2 font-montserrat">1. Service Description</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 font-inter">
        PlayerDoge facilitates the purchase of in-game currency and bundles on behalf of its users.
        We do not directly sell digital goods but instead serve as a third-party intermediary to
        obtain them at better rates.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-inter">
        <strong>Order Process:</strong> Users can submit purchase requests through our platform. We
        reserve the right to accept or decline any order at our discretion.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-inter">
        <strong>Order Fulfillment:</strong> Upon order acceptance, we may request a one-time
        verification code to securely log into your game account and complete the transaction.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-inter">
        <strong>Account Linking (Optional):</strong> You may save your login credentials for faster
        repeat purchases. These credentials are used exclusively to access your account like any

      <p className="mb-4 font-inter">
        <strong>Chargeback Policy:</strong> Any attempt at a chargeback will be challenged with
